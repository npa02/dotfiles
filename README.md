## Backup existing `dotfiles` and `configs`

I'm, actually .. kind of .. proud of my `.aliases`. Though not much, but I have gone quite a long way, from ground zero.

Backup if needed:

```bash
./dfs.sh -b
./cfg.sh -b
./pkg_backup
```

## Install `dotfiles` and `configs`

Sync all, or choose what you want.

```bash
./dfs.sh -i
./cfg.sh -i
```

Uninstall with:

```bash
./dfs.sh -u
./cfg.sh -u
```
